In such a setting, a key technical piece of infrastructure is the development pipeline that consists of various tools and databases, where features ﬂow from development to deployment and then further to use. Metrics, unlike those conventionally used in software development, are needed to help deﬁne the performance of the development pipeline. In this paper, we address metrics that are suited for supporting continuous delivery and deployment through a descriptive and exploratory single case study on a project of a mid-sized Finnish software company, Solita Plc. As concrete data, we use data from project ”Lupapiste”, a web site for managing municipal authorizations and permissions.},

You'll review important concepts, such as repeatable deployment techniques, advanced {OpenShift} {RBAC} capabilities, monitoring clusters, and integrating with external services. You'll also see how to run specialized workloads in {OpenShift} and how to deploy non-web based applications on the platform, all designed to help cultivate best practices as your organization continue evolve in microservices architectures. {OpenShift} has become the main enterprise Kubernetes distribution and its market penetration continues to growth at rapid rate. While {OpenShift}'s documentation provides a great list of configuration options to work with the platform, it can be a daunting task to wade through. Architecting and Operating {OpenShift} Clusters breaks this content down into clear and useful concepts to provide you with a solid understanding of the {OCP} internal architecture.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has received increasing interest from enterprises since its inception. With its innovative information technology ({IT}) services delivery model, cloud computing could add technical and strategic business value to enterprises. However, cloud computing poses highly concerning internal (e.g., Top management and experience) and external issues (e.g., regulations and standards). This paper presents a systematic literature review to explore the current key issues related to cloud computing adoption. This is achieved by reviewing 51 articles published about cloud computing adoption. Using the grounded theory approach, articles are classified into eight main categories: internal, external, evaluation, proof of concept, adoption decision, implementation and integration, {IT} governance, and confirmation. Then, the eight categories are divided into two abstract categories: cloud computing adoption factors and processes, where the former affects the latter. The results of this review indicate that enterprises face serious issues before they decide to adopt cloud computing. Based on the findings, the paper provides a future information systems ({IS}) research agenda to explore the previously under-investigated areas regarding cloud computing adoption factors and processes. This paper calls for further theoretical, methodological, and empirical contributions to the research area of cloud computing adoption by enterprises.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is an ascending technology that has introduced a new paradigm by rendering a rational computational model possible. It has changed the dynamics of {IT} consumption by means of a model that provides on-demand services over the Internet. Unlike the traditional hosting service, cloud computing services are paid for per usage and may expand or shrink based on demand. Such services are, in general, fully managed by cloud providers that require users nothing but a personal computer and an Internet access. In recent years, this model has attracted the attention of researchers, investors and practitioners, many of whom have proposed a number of applications, structures and fundamentals of cloud computing, resulting in various definitions, requirements and models. Despite the interest and advances in the field, issues such as security and privacy, service layer agreement, resource sharing, and billing have opened up new questions about the real gains of the model. Although cloud computing is based on a 50-year-old business model, evidence from this study indicates that cloud computing still needs to expand and overcome present limitations that prevent the full use of its potential. In this study, we critically review the state of the art in cloud computing with the aim of identifying advances, gaps and new challenges.},

Google developed Kubernetes, which orchestrates containers efficiently and is considered the frontrunner in container orchestration. Kubernetes is an orchestrator that creates and manages your containers on clusters of servers. This book will guide you from simply deploying a container to administrate a Kubernetes cluster, and then you will learn how to do monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in {DevOps}. The initial stages of the book will introduce the fundamental {DevOps} and the concept of containers. It will move on to how to containerize applications and deploy them into. The book will then introduce networks in Kubernetes. We then move on to advanced {DevOps} skills such as monitoring, logging, and continuous deployment in Kubernetes. It will proceed to introduce permission control for Kubernetes resources via attribute-based access control and role-based access control. The final stage of the book will cover deploying and managing your container clusters on the popular public cloud Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform. At the end of the book, other orchestration frameworks, such as Docker Swarm mode, Amazon {ECS}, and Apache Mesos will be discussed.Style and {approachReaders} will be taken through fundamental {DevOps} skills and Kubernetes concept and administration with detailed examples. It introduces comprehensive {DevOps} topics, including microservices, automation tools, containers, monitoring, logging, continuous delivery, and popular public cloud environments.

	abstract = {This is the Safari online edition of the printed book.Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours—sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks.

But what does each one do for your product development and release cycles? Brent Laster explains what these terms really boil down to, and how they work separately and together to help your team release software.This powerful set of disciplines, best practices, and technologies automates the process of integrating and delivering source code changes from inception through production. Although their implementation may vary, these processes are necessary to ensure that software is released frequently, reliably, and with high quality.You’ll learn how:Continuous integration ensures that individual code changes are suitable for inclusion in the code base and merged in {successfullyContinuous} delivery assembles your product, automatically testing the quality and functionality along the way, and produces deliverables that are proven to be {deployableContinuous} deployment simplifies releasing the product to customers, whether it’s in the cloud, via download, or in some other format, while also allowing for limited deployments or rolling deployments back},

In the existing scenario, Insurance industry need to better respond to dynamic market requirements, faster time to market for new initiatives and services, and support innovative ways of customer interaction. In past few years, the transition to cloud platforms has given benefits such as agility, scalability, and lower capital costs but the application lifecycle management practices are slow with this disruptive change. {DevOps} culture extends the agile methodology to rapidly create applications and deliver them across environment in automated manner to improve performance and quality assurance. Continuous Integration ({CI}) and Continuous delivery ({CD}) has emerged as a boon for traditional application development and release management practices to provide the capability to release quality artifacts continuously to customers with continuously integrated feedback. The objective of the paper is to create a proof of concept for designing an effective framework for continuous integration, continuous testing, and continuous delivery to automate the source code compilation, code analysis, test execution, packaging, infrastructure provisioning, deployment, and notifications using build pipeline concept.},

	abstract = {Despite substantial recent research activity related to continuous delivery and deployment ({CD}), there has not yet been a systematic, empirical study on how the practices often associated with continuous deployment have found their way into the broader software industry. This raises the question to what extent our knowledge of the area is dominated by the peculiarities of a small number of industrial leaders, such as Facebook. To address this issue, we conducted a mixed-method empirical study, consisting of a pre-study on literature, qualitative interviews with 20 software developers or release engineers with heterogeneous backgrounds, and a Web-based quantitative survey that attracted 187 complete responses. A major trend in the results of our study is that architectural issues are currently one of the main barriers for {CD} adoption. Further, feature toggles as an implementation technique for partial rollouts lead to unwanted complexity, and require research on better abstractions and modelling techniques for runtime variability. Finally, we conclude that practitioners are in need for more principled approaches to release decision making, e.g., which features to conduct A/B tests on, or which metrics to evaluate.},

	abstract = {Context
Continuous Deployment ({CD}) is an emerging software development process with organisations such as Facebook, Microsoft, and {IBM} successfully implementing and using the process. The {CD} process aims to immediately deploy software to customers as soon as new code is developed, and can result in a number of benefits for organisations, such as: new business opportunities, reduced risk for each release, and prevent development of wasted software. There is little academic literature on the challenges organisations face when adopting the {CD} process, however there are many anecdotal challenges that organisations have voiced on their online blogs.
Objective
The aim of this research is to examine the challenges faced by organisations when adopting {CD} as well as the strategies to mitigate these challenges.
Method
An explorative case study technique that involves in-depth interviews with software practitioners in an organisation that has adopted {CD} was conducted to identify these challenges.
Results
This study found a total of 20 technical and social adoption challenges that organisations may face when adopting the {CD} process. The results are discussed to gain a deeper understanding of the strategies employed by organisations to mitigate the impacts of these challenges.
Conclusion
While a number of individual technical and social adoption challenges were uncovered by the case study in this research, most challenges were not faced in isolation. The severity of these challenges were reduced by a number of mitigation strategies employed by the case study organisation. It is concluded that organisations need to be well prepared to handle technical and social adoption challenges with their existing expertise, processes and tools before adopting the {CD} process. For practitioners, knowing how to address the challenges an organisation may face when adopting the {CD} process provides a level of awareness that they previously may not have had.},

They also aimed to find out why continuous deployment is considered beneficial and what the obstacles are to its full adoption. The benefits mentioned the most often were the ability to get faster feedback, the ability to deploy more often to keep customers satisfied, and improved quality and productivity. Despite understanding the benefits, none of the companies adopted a fully automatic deployment pipeline. The companies also had higher continuous-deployment capability than what they practiced. In many cases, they consciously chose to not aim for full continuous deployment. Obstacles to full adoption included domain-imposed restrictions, resistance to change, customer desires, and developers' skill and confidence.},
